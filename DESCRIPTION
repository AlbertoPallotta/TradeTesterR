Description: A comprehensive backtesting framework designed to democratize access to 
    institutional-grade trading system development tools. Built specifically for 
    educational purposes, individual traders, and academic researchers who need 
    transparent, realistic backtesting capabilities without expensive licensing fees. 
    The framework features an innovative dual-timeframe architecture that separates 
    strategy signals from execution mechanics, teaching users the crucial distinction 
    between decision-making and trade implementation. Unlike black-box commercial 
    platforms, TradeTesterR exposes each step of the trading process through clear 
    data transformations, enabling users to examine exactly how signals generate, 
    orders execute, and positions evolve. The framework handles real-world complexities 
    including limit orders that may not fill, stop orders that gap through their 
    trigger prices, partial position exits, realistic slippage modeling, and 
    comprehensive transaction costs. All strategy information is represented in 
    tabular format using data.table for both performance and pedagogical clarity, 
    allowing users to inspect and verify behavior at any point in the development 
    process.
