\title{Compare in-sample vs out-of-sample performance}
\usage{
compareISOS(optimization_output, optimize_on = "net_profit")
}
\arguments{
\item{optimization_output}{Output from optimizeStrategy() with return_optimization_details = TRUE}

\item{optimize_on}{The metric that was used for optimization (default: "net_profit")}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - performance_comparison: data.table comparing IS and OOS metrics for each window
  - summary_stats: Summary statistics including average degradation and correlation
  - plots: List of visualizations (scatter plot, time series, degradation histogram)
  - recommendation: Text recommendation based on the analysis
}
\description{
Analyzes the degradation between optimization (in-sample) performance
and actual (out-of-sample) results to assess overfitting.
