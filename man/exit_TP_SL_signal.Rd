\title{Default exit function with multiple exit types}
\usage{
exit_TP_SL_signal(dis)
}
\arguments{
\item{dis}{A data.table subset for one trade containing:
- Price data (Open.a, High.a, Low.a, Close.a, Open.b, High.b, Low.b, Close.b)
- Side: 1 for long, -1 for short
- OrderSize: Position size
- Optional: StopLoss, TakeProfit, exit_long, exit_short
- Optional: targetorder_long_N, stoporder_long_N (for partial exits)}
}
\value{
A data.table with exit information including:
  - ExitTime, ExitPrice, ExitAmount, ExitReason
  - CurrentPosSize: Remaining position after exit
}
\description{
Implements various exit mechanisms including stop loss, take profit,
trailing stops/targets, and signal-based exits. Supports partial position exits.
}
\details{
Exit types supported:
- Fixed stop loss and take profit
- Trailing stops: stoporder_long_1, stoporder_short_1
- Trailing targets: targetorder_long_1, targetorder_short_1
- Signal exits: exit_long, exit_short (values 0-1 for partial exits)
- Time-based exits (handled by backtest function)

For partial exits, use numbered orders (e.g., targetorder_long_1, targetorder_long_2)
with corresponding _amount columns specifying exit fraction.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# In strategy definition:
price[, StopLoss := EntryPrice - 2 * ATR]
price[, TakeProfit := EntryPrice + 3 * ATR]

# For partial exits:
price[, targetorder_long_1 := EntryPrice + 1 * ATR]
price[, targetorder_long_1_amount := 0.5]  # Exit 50\%
}
}
